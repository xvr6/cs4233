# Design Patterns Overview

- **Principles** are used to *diagnose* problems with designs
- **Patterns** are used to *address* the problems

## What is a design pattern?

- A standard solution to a common programming problem
  - A design or implementation structure that achieves a particular purpose
  - a high-level programming idiom
- A technique for making code more flexible or efficient
  - reduce coupling among program components
  - reduce memory overhead
- Shorthand for describing program design
  - A description of connections among program components
  - the shape of an object model

## Types of Design Patterns

One could come up with their own solutions, but they wouldn't need to. Design patterns are known solutions to a known problem.

- **Creation patterns**: how objects are instantiated
  - Creation patterns abstract the object instantiation process
  - They hide how objects are created and help make the overall system independent of how its objects are created and composed
  - *Types*:
    - Factory (method)
    - Builder
    - Abstract factory
    - Prototype
    - Flyweight
    - Singleton
- **Structural patterns**: how objects/classes can be combined
  - Structural patterns are concerned with how objects are composed to form larger objects
  - Structural patterns enable client code to:
    - Unify access to composite objects
    - modify the interface
    - extend behavior
  - *Types*:
    - Composite
    - Decorator
    - Adapter
    - Facade
    - Proxy
- **Behavior patterns**: how objects communicate
  - Behavior patterns identify and capture common patterns of communication between objects.
  - *Types*:
    - State
    - Strategy
    - Observer
    - Template method
    - Command
    - Iterator
    - Null Object
